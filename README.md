A simple and lightweight PHP Framework 

## Motivation
    Why build a Web PHP framework in 2024?
The motivation behind this framework is simply for me to understand the core vitals of majority of the current market frameworks for PHP, Alonside with PSRs and good pratices

    Should i use it in production?
NO, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK I WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT
    
    What you pretend to achieve with this?
My final goal is a PSR-7 compliant framework with great interoperability and a DoctrineORM support, focused on API development

## Key Features

- Symfony's HTTPKernel implementation
- Solid base for custom framework development
- Fast by simplicity
- Great extensibility with Event Dispatching

## Roadmap

- [ ] Compiled Routes
- [ ] Middlewares
- [ ] Monolog Integration
- [ ] Env Support
- [ ] DoctrineORM integration
- [ ] Serialization
- [ ] Non Blocking I/O Engines Support
